Car Listings Backend
This repository contains the backend implementation for a car listings application, developed using C#. It provides the necessary functionality to manage car listings, including creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of car information.

Features
Create a new car listing with details such as make, model, year, price, and description.
Retrieve a list of all car listings.
Retrieve a specific car listing by its ID.
Update an existing car listing with new information.
Delete a car listing.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/simonas-a/kmp-api.git
Open the solution file CarListingsBackend.sln in your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio).

Build the solution to restore NuGet packages and compile the project.

Configuration
Before running the application, ensure that the following configuration settings are properly set:

Database Connection String: Update the database connection string in the appsettings.json file to point to your desired database server.
Database Setup
Create a new database on your chosen database server.

Execute the SQL script provided in the database.sql file to create the necessary tables and schema.

Usage
Run the application in your preferred IDE, or you can also build and run it from the command line.

Use an API testing tool (e.g., Postman, Insomnia) or any HTTP client to interact with the backend API.

Make HTTP requests to the appropriate endpoints to perform the desired actions on car listings. The available endpoints include:

GET /api/cars - Retrieve a list of all car listings.
GET /api/cars/{id} - Retrieve a specific car listing by its ID.
POST /api/cars - Create a new car listing.
PUT /api/cars/{id} - Update an existing car listing.
